# SwoleMate - Social Fitness Mobile Application
## Problem Statement
Fitness is an integral aspect of our mental and physical wellbeing, but getting started or being consistent can be difficult when you are doing it yourself! What if you need some guidance, assistance, accountability, or just someone to do it with you to make it more fun? These issues can apply to beginners or seasoned athletes - sometimes it is difficult to find somebody who shares your goals and/or can workout with you. 

## Vision Statement
This app will be designed for fitness novices, enthusiasts, and athletes (of any kind) seeking to find somebody to train with them. Called SwoleMate, it will provide opportunities for individuals to connect with a gym buddy. You will be able to filter individuals based on the type of workout (cardio, strength, hypertrophy), experience (novices, athletes, and everything in between), and other criteria. The most compelling aspect to our application is that it will connect people who share or want to foster a passion for fitness. Say you want to run a half marathon this weekend, it would be a lot easier to do with someone who has the same idea in mind! The only things on the market currently are apps to find workout groups for specific things - such as Meetup with their Fitness Groups - and even then they lack the social aspect to them that we provide. For example, Strava is popular in the running and cyclist community, but does not have capabilities to match and coordinate events between two people. We will enhance the social aspect by having profiles, pictures, and reviews - this also serves to create comfort in meeting strangers. In essence, our application will connect people with shared, specific goals, and facilitate communication within the app, ensuring to connect individuals in the same geographical location.
